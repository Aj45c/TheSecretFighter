# Description
This app serves the purpose of introducing users to fighting games that aren't so popular or are completely under the radar! The list of games and website will continue to be updated based on games that I find and games that are suggested to me.

# Getting Started

# My Next Steps
* Make the index page look more like a character select screen from a fighting game
* Add the ability to comment on certain games
* End Goal is to make it like a forum
